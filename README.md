## Description
This project is a practical assessment for the Frontend Engineer position at Lendsqr. It includes a React application using TypeScript and SCSS to build a login page, a dashboard, user pages, and user detail pages. The application fetches data from a mock API and demonstrates capabilities in handling state, routing, and responsive design.

- then having to maintain responsivness literally gave me hell
- I had to repeat the project twice hence the lendsqr2
